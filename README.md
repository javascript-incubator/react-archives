Boilerplate for creating Arcgis Web Application üåè with React-Redux and Webpack (_and without Dojo_),

Primed with üíâ Bleeding Edge Mapping and Frontend Techs, like it uses

- [ESRI's Arcgis API for Javascript v 4.4](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/) for Maps(_I know_)
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) as Immutable State Container, _obviously_ with React as View Engine
- [Indra](https://github.com/rajatsharma305/indra) as Mutable State Container.
- [Esri Promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esri-promise) for loading Dojo Modules, so that we can build our project with Webpack
- [Webpack 2](https://webpack.js.org/) for building Project
- [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) for Styling Components(sass and css are also supported, out of the box)
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) this boilerplate supports sass along with css
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) for Linting Javascript, following [Standardjs](https://standardjs.com/) style guide
